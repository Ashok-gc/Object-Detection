**# Object detection on video stream**

This code performs real-time object detection on a video stream using OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model. The video stream can be a file or the default camera (usually the webcam).

# Requirements
1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. OpenCV 4.5 or higher
3. A pre-trained object detection model

# Usage
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Download a pre-trained object detection model and place it in the same directory as this code. The model should be in a format supported by OpenCV, such as TensorFlow or Darknet.
3. Update the path to the video file or camera if necessary in the line `cap = cv2.VideoCapture('road.mp4')`.
4. If the video file cannot be opened, the default camera will be used. If the default camera is not available, an error will be raised.
5. Set the font scale and font type for the text that will be displayed on the video in the lines `font_scale = 3` and `font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_PLAIN`.
6. Run the code and wait for the video stream to appear.
7. Objects detected in the video stream will be outlined with a bounding box and labeled with the class name.


# Troubleshooting
If you encounter an error related to resizing the input frame, check the expected dimensions of the input frame for your object detection model and update the values of `expected_height` and `expected_width` in the code accordingly.
